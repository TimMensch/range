range [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/tiny-range.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/tiny-range) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Tjatse/range.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Tjatse/range)
=====

Range parser that parse range from string, e.g. "0, 1, 7~8, 9-10, 100~105" -> [[0, 1], [7, 10], [100, 105]]

# Features
- Verify input.
- Automatic merge overlapped range.
- Wrap continuous numbers into range.

# Forked version differences

- Returns TinyRange as a named object (for easier inclusion in ES6 modules with Rollup)
- Actually parses the dash as a range separator (which is implied in the docs, but was not actually supported)

# Installation
```bash
$ npm install TimMensch/tiny-range
```

# Usage
```javascript
var TinyRange = require('tiny-range').TinyRange;
var range = new TinyRange();

var result = range.parse('0, 1, 7~8, 9-10, 100~105');

// result: [[0, 1], [7, 10], [100, 105]]
```

## Tips of range
- **From minimum to a specific number**

  ```
  ~100
  ```

- **From a specific number to maximum**

  ```
  100~
  ```

- **Number**

  ```
  23
  ```

- **Range**

  ```
  -10~10
  ```
  or
  ```
  -10-10
  ```

## Advanced Usage
```javascript
var result = range.parse('~-5, -3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 7~8, 9-20, 100~');

// result: [[-4294967295,-5],-3,[0,3],[7,8],[100,4294967295]]
```

**Notes** Boundary is from `-(2^32 - 1)` to `(2^32 - 1)`, i.e. `-4294967295` to `4294967295`.
